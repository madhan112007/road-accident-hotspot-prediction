## 🧩 Overview
The **Road Accident Hotspot Prediction** project leverages data analytics and machine learning to predict potential accident hotspots based on historical road accident data.  
It supports proactive planning and decision-making to improve road safety and minimize fatalities.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
- Collect and preprocess historical accident datasets.  
- Train ML models to detect and predict accident hotspots.  
- Visualize high-risk zones on an interactive map.  
- Provide insights for traffic authorities and city planners.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Data preprocessing and visualization  
- Machine learning–based hotspot detection  
- Map-based hotspot visualization (using Folium / Plotly)  
- Scalable and adaptable for multiple regions

## 🧱 System Architecture

The system follows a modular data analytics workflow consisting of the following stages:

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Gather accident datasets from open data sources, traffic records, and public APIs.  

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and normalize coordinates.  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Extract key attributes such as time, location, weather, and accident severity.  

4. **Model Training & Validation**  
   - Apply clustering (e.g., K-Means) and regression models to identify high-risk zones.  

5. **Hotspot Prediction**  
   - Predict potential accident-prone areas based on trained models.  

6. **Visualization Dashboard**  
   - Display results dynamically on an interactive map for analysis and decision-making.



## 📊 Results
- Accurate identification of high-risk zones.  
- Improved awareness for traffic authorities and citizens.  
- Supports real-time monitoring for future improvements.
